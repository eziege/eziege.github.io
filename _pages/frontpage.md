Hi! I am a PhD student at the <a href="https://www.bib.bund.de/DE/Institut/Mitarbeiter/Ziege/Ziege.html" style="color:black; text-decoration: underline;" >Federal Institute for Population Research (BiB)</a>, Wiesbaden and the <a href="https://startseite.uni-mainz.de" style="color:black; text-decoration: underline;">Johannes Gutenberg University</a>, Mainz. I am a PhD Affiliate at the <a href="https://biplab.uchicago.edu" style="color:black; text-decoration: underline;">Behavioral Insights and Parenting Lab</a> at the Harris School of Public Policy at the University of Chicago.

My research focuses on family economics, especially in relation to education and migration. More details on my publications and work in progress can be found <a href="/research.html" style="color:black; text-decoration: underline;">here</a>. Feel free to get in touch with me to discuss my research or if you're interested in preliminary versions of papers I'm currently working on.
