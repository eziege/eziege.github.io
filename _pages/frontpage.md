My name is Elena and I am a PhD student at the [Federal Institute for Population Research (BiB)](https://www.bib.bund.de/DE/Institut/Mitarbeiter/Ziege/Ziege.html), Wiesbaden and the [Johannes Gutenberg University](https://startseite.uni-mainz.de), Mainz.

My main research interests are family economics, education economics and migration economics.

Feel free to get in touch with me to discuss my research.
