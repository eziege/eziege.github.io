    <summary>Abstract</summary>
Employment among mothers has been rising in recent decades, although mothers of young children often work fewer hours than other women do. Parallel to this trend, approval of maternal employment has increased, albeit not evenly across groups. However, differences in attitudes remain unexplored despite their importance for better understanding mothers’ labour market behaviour. Meanwhile, the employment of fathers has remained stable and attitudes towards paternal employment do not differ as much as attitudes towards maternal employment do between socio-economic groups.
This paper examines attitudes towards maternal and paternal employment. It focuses on Germany, drawing on data from the German Family Demography Panel Study (FReDA). The survey explicitly asks whether mothers and fathers should be in paid work, work part-time or full-time, presenting respondents with fictional family profiles that vary the youngest child’s age. Unlike previous studies, the analysis compares the views of respondents with different origins: West Germany, East Germany, immigrants from different world regions, and second-generation migrants in West Germany.
The results highlight remarkable differences between respondents from West and East Germany, with the former group displaying strong approval for part-time employment among mothers and fathers of very young children and the latter group reporting higher approval for full-time employment. Immigrant groups are far from homogenous, holding different attitudes depending on their region of origin. Taken together, the results offer a nuanced picture of attitudes towards maternal and paternal employment. We discuss these findings in relation to labour markets participation in Germany.

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
Grandparents act as the third largest caregiver for children after parental care and daycare in Germany, as in many Western societies. Adopting a double-generation perspective, we investigate the causal impact of this care mode on parental well-being and children's overall
health as one dimension of child well-being. We analyze age-speci c e ects based on a representative German panel data set and exploit arguably exogenous variations in geographical distance to grandparents. Our results suggest positive e ects on parental satisfaction with the childcare situation and mothers' satisfaction with leisure. In contrast, our results point to negative e ects on children's health in the short run. If children three years and older are in full-time daycare or school and, in addition, regularly cared for by grandparents, they have worse health outcomes.

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
Many western countries are currently facing three major challenges. First, they experience increasing inflows of immigrants. Secondly, in the majority of countries, immigrant children, on average, exhibit lower academic performance in comparison to their non-immigrant peers. The third challenge is the unmet demand for highly skilled labor as a consequence of demographic change. One policy that may help to tackle these challenges is the granting of citizenship to immigrant children, promoting integration and education. To provide a more thorough account of the total benefits of citizenship, I examine not only the direct effects on these immigrant children but also spillover effects on their older siblings. Event study and difference-in-differences approaches are employed, taking advantage of the implementation of birthright citizenship in Germany for children born after 2000 and comparing children born around the birthdate cut-off. Analyses using the German Microcensus and the National Educational Panel Study (NEPS) provide evidence that birthright citizenship is advantageous for the education of children specifically targeted by the reform and also has positive spillover effects on the academic school track completion of their older siblings. Further analyses indicate that these spillover effects are driven by increased parental investments, particularly towards the older siblings. These findings reveal that previous assessments of citizenship have underestimated its benefits.
