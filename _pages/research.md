#### **Does Grandparenting Pay off for the Next Generations? Intergenerational Effects of Grandparental Care (with Mara Barschkett and C. Katharina Spiess)**

Grandparents act as the third largest caregiver after parental care and daycare in Germany, as in many Western societies. Adopting a double-generation perspective, we investigate the causal impact of this care mode on children’s health, socio-emotional behavior, and school outcomes, as well as parental well-being. Based on representative German panel data sets, and exploiting arguably exogenous variations in geographical distance to grandparents, we analyze age-specific effects, taking into account alternative care modes. Our results suggest mainly null and in few cases negative effects on children’s outcomes. If children three years and older are in full-time daycare or school and, in addition, regularly cared for by grandparents, they have more health and socio-emotional problems, in particular conduct problems. In contrast, our results point to positive effects on parental satisfaction with the childcare situation and mothers' satisfaction with leisure. 


#### **Should Mama or Papa Work? Variations in attitudes towards parental employment by country of origin and child age (with Ludovica Gambaro, C. Katharina Spiess and Katharina Wrohlich)**

In the last decades employment among mothers has been rising, although mothers of young children often work fewer hours than other women. Parallel to this trend, approval towards maternal employment has increased, albeit not evenly across groups. Differences in attitudes remain however unexplored despite their importance to better understand mothers’ labour market behaviour. Employment of fathers has remained stable in the last decades and attitudes towards paternal employment do not differ as much as attitudes towards employment of mothers between socio-economic groups. This paper examines the attitudes towards maternal and paternal employment. It focuses on Germany, drawing on FReDA data. The survey explicitly asks respondents whether mothers and fathers should be in paid work, work part-time or full-time, and further differentiates by children’s age. Unlike previous studies, the analysis compares the views of respondents with different origin: West Germany, East Germany, immigrants from different regions, and second generation migrants in West Germany. Results highlight remarkable differences between respondents from West Germany and those from East Germany, with the former group displaying strong approval for part-time employment among mothers and among fathers of very young children. Immigrant groups are far from homogenous, holding different attitudes depending on region of origin. Taken together the results offer a very nuanced picture on attitudes towards maternal and paternal employment and are discussed in relation to labour markets participation in Germany.
